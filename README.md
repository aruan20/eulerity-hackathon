## Future Improvements

### Styling

In addition to overall improvements on styling, a major improvement would be to have the background change when making a pet selection. This would clearly indicate which pet is selected / not selected to the user.

### Filter Feature

In order to search by title or description, the user needs to click on the search icon. The feature could be refined by allowing the user to search by pressing the enter key as well.
